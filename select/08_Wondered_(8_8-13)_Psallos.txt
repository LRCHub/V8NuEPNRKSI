Declares the Lord of all
"When I will covenant anew
With Israel and Judah, both
A better one than long ago
A better law"

"I'll put this Law onto their minds
And write it on their hearts
From everlasting, I've designed
That I will be their God above
And they shall be my people, loved
And set apart"

"Behold the days are coming soon"
Declares the Lord
"When I will make all things new"
And you'll no longer need to teach
Your neighbor, Joe, your best friend, Pete
For everyone, from big to small
Will know me well, and I'll recall
Their sins no more"

If you endure

A new and better way
The old has come and gone
The shadows fade away
The light of heaven dawns

A new and better way
A new and better way
The earthly shadows fade
The light of heaven breaks

A new and better way
