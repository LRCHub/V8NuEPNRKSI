Prison gates won't open up for me
On these hands and knees, I'm crawlin'
Oh, I reach for you
I'm terrified of these four walls
These iron bars can't hold my soul in
All I need is you (come, please, I'm callin')
And oh, I scream for you (hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin')
Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Chris Daughtry
Show me what it's like (to be the last one standing)
And teach me wrong from right (and I'll show you what I can be)
And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me
Heaven's gates won't open up for me
With these broken wings, I'm fallin'
All I see is you
These city walls ain't got no love for me
I'm on the ledge of the eighteenth story
And oh, I scream for you (come, please, I'm callin')
And all I need is you (hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin')
Show me what it's like (to be the last one standing)
And teach me wrong from right (and I'll show you what I can be)
And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me
Hurry, I'm fallin' (oh, yeah)
And all I need is you (come, please, I'm callin')
And oh, I scream for you (hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin')
Show me what it's like (to be the last one standing)
And teach me wrong from right (and I'll show you what I can be)
And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me (hurry, I'm fallin')
And say it for me, say it to me
And I'll leave this life behind me
Say it if it's worth savin' me
